# Piscine_42

Here is my repo of all my exercices done during my piscine at 42 Perpignan in July 2023.


In all my repos, you'll find a precious directory called x_mains.


Thoses directories contains tests I wrote myself (for the most part).

// DISCLAIMER //

From now, do not rely much on the exercices themselves, as they didn't went through the moulinette.
This repo is, for now, here mostly for the test !

This repo will be updated when I'll start 42, with my scores and stuff !

Feel free to create pull requests and issues, I'll be happy to merge/fix them !

And more important : copying code from Github without understanding it.... it's lame.
